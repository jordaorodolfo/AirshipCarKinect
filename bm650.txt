%141125/150407: bm65

preDRONI modelling using xls input and battery discharging model

evolution of bm64 model with:
-axi motors with 4s lipo and props
-t-motors and props 17x12 using 29.6V 8s2p battery (bm645)
 (still alternatives to be tested in forbm65x script)
-idem for motors/props position...

-mass and inertias defined in xls
-ground or configuration parameters defined in xls

-added one state in fbm for battery model:
->one extra state in act X(30)=It=int(sum(Imi)*dt) (trim:It0=XU0(32))
->one 'other output' is current battery voltage: Vm=y(32)=f0(62)
->initial State of Charge may be defined to check effect on model

remaining issues:
-trim functions are perfectible because of redundant inputs
which turns minimization into a complex problem; 
the power minimization is a tentative example
allowing a more continuous trim from HF to AF and should help in control
task adaption

150321: few minor corrections
150321: forbm65 as function: allows to define a new drive setup
150407: added resistance of power cables
